# spaceXApplication
A responsive React application showing the details of all Rockets launched by Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp.(SpaceX) between 2006-2020.
It provides in-depth details of the rockets including their year of launch & land with their success status, cartoon logo of the mission etc. This application also allows Users to filter details by year, launch success and landing success. This project is a good example of Responsive Web Application build using React.


# Learning Curve
Being a big fan of Elon Musk, This project is my personal favourite and it has helped me in gaining in-depth knowledge about the different technologies which are used to implement superb Web Applications. I got a better understanding of the Data and Structure types. The wonderful responsive design and user friendly UI is the uniqueness of this Project. I would like to thank Publicis.Sapient for giving me this opportunity to develop this Application.
